      id: 'retrograde-motion',
      term: 'Retrograde Motion',
      definition: 'Apparent westward motion of a planet with respect to the stars. From Earth, this happens when an outer planet appears to move backwards in its orbit as Earth overtakes it.'
    },
    {
      id: 'kuiper-belt',
      term: 'Kuiper Belt',
      definition: 'A region of the outer solar system extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt, but it is far larger—20 times as wide and 20–200 times as massive.'
    },
    {
      id: 'gas-giant',
      term: 'Gas Giant',
      definition: 'A large planet that is not primarily composed of rock or other solid matter. Gas giants typically consist primarily of hydrogen and helium, with varying amounts of methane, ammonia, and water. Examples include Jupiter and Saturn.'
    },
    {
      id: 'ice-giant',
      term: 'Ice Giant',
      definition: 'A type of giant planet composed mainly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur—the "ices" in planetary science. Examples include Uranus and Neptune.'
    },
    {
      id: 'celestial-body',
      term: 'Celestial Body',
      definition: 'A natural object outside of Earth\'s atmosphere, such as the Moon, Sun, a planet, or a star.'
    },
    {
      id: 'asteroid-belt',
      term: 'Asteroid Belt',
      definition: 'The region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where most asteroids are found. It is composed of numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.'
    },
    {
      id: 'light-year',
      term: 'Light-year',
      definition: 'A unit of length used to express astronomical distances, equal to about 9.46 trillion kilometers (5.88 trillion miles). It is the distance light travels in one year.'
    },
    {
      id: 'astronomical-unit',
      term: 'Astronomical Unit (AU)',
      definition: 'A unit of length, roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun and defined as 149,597,870.7 kilometers. It is commonly used to measure distances within our solar system.'
    },
    {
      id: 'galaxy',
      term: 'Galaxy',
      definition: 'A gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias, literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way galaxy.'
